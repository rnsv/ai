## AI, AI, everywhere, which one do I use?

_B. Srinivasan, K. Dunlap, S. Ahmed_

AI is here and it is here to stay whether that thrills or scares us. The education sector stands at the precipice of a significant AI-driven transformation. AI-powered tutors, automated grading systems, and personalized learning platforms are expected to simplify processes, address individual student needs, and ultimately improve learning outcomes. Basically, it is being hailed as a miracle, and the bombardment of choices is overwhelming. We share our experience with select general platforms and educational AI that we have found helpful in engaging students.

**All** Major AI platforms offer unique capabilities that educators can leverage:

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Most of you are already using it, therefore we will not dive into details here.
- **Google Gemini:** This tool suggests relevant images from the web to accompany educational materials. It can simplify complex topics, provide examples, and even assist with coding and math problems effectively.
- **Microsoft Copilot:** This is a powerful AI that can generate images in addition to text. It helps solve visual and math problems, suggests creative connections between concepts, and recommends reputable sources for research, aiding in lesson enrichment.
- **Claude (Anthropic):** Similar to ChatGPT but focused on advanced mathematics and image understanding capabilities. Claude can analyze visuals, diagrams, and data representations, making it a useful tool for STEM subjects.
- **Synthesia**: This provides a powerful tool for educators to create engaging and personalized video content. By converting text to video, educators can transform lesson plans, explanations, and student presentations into visually captivating learning materials. This is beneficial for diverse learning styles, particularly those who benefit from auditory and visual information. However, it is important to note that high-quality audio is needed for optimal results and there may be restrictions on video length based on the chosen platform.

| **AI Tool** | **Focus** | **Strengths** | **Uniqueness** | **Limitations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**Google Gemini**](https://gemini.google.com/app) | Information retrieval and explanation | Suggests relevant images, breaks down complex topics, assists with coding and math problems | Integrates well with Google products, and strong visual search capabilities | May not be ideal for in-depth subject matter expertise |
| [**Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com) | Text and image generation | Generates images and text, solves visual and math problems, suggests creative connections | Powerful for visual learning and brainstorming, multi-modal capabilities | Can be overly creative, leading to inaccurate outputs |
| [**Claude (Anthropic)**](https://copilot.microsoft.com) | Advanced mathematics and image understanding | Analyzes visuals, diagrams, and data representations | Focused on STEM subjects, strong data analysis capabilities | Limited access compared to other tools |
| [**Synthesia (Text-to-Video)**](https://www.synthesia.io/) | Video creation | Converts text to engaging narrated videos with a variety of avatars and settings | Personalized learning experiences, caters to diverse learning styles | Requires high-quality audio for best results, may have limitations on video length |

The above-mentioned general AI platforms can work together with specialized educational AI-powered tools such as:

- **Brisk Teaching (a Chrome extension):** Educators have the ability to adjust and personalize the AI-generated results to suit their specific requirements. This Chrome extension can easily be integrated with learning management systems.

**Beyond Brisk Teaching, other valuable AI-powered educational tools include:**

- **Aspose.ai:** This platform provides a variety of free and paid tools for creating interactive learning activities. One of its tools is the _AI Crossword Generator_, which uses natural language processing to make crossword puzzles related to specific topics or vocabulary lists. This helps reinforce learning, adapt to different levels, conduct assessments, and allow teachers to create their own puzzles. Aspose.ai also offers other tools like _Summarizer and Paraphrase_, which can summarize complex content and generate unique writing styles. These tools are accessible through a web browser and help educators save time, increase engagement, and promote self-directed learning experiences using AI.
- **EdPuzzle:** Offers AI-powered interactive video lessons that can be easily integrated with learning management systems. It allows educators to create video-based quizzes and assignments from various video sources, including their own lecture videos and is a very useful tool for online teaching. The AI can automatically insert questions at key points during the video to check for understanding. Additionally, educators can use the "no skip" feature to ensure that students watch the entire video. This makes EdPuzzle a valuable tool for creating engaging multimedia lessons that maintain student focus.
- **Almanack:** employs AI for tasks such as lesson planning, curriculum integration aligned with standards, assessment creation, and the generation of instructional resources.
- **Teachology:** combines AI with human expertise to develop courses aligned with specific learning outcomes, create assessments, and produce customized lesson plans for educators.

| **Tool** | **Focus** | **Strengths** | **Uniqueness** | **Limitations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**Brisk Teaching (Chrome extension)**](https://www.briskteaching.com/) | Curriculum development and lesson planning | Offers a suite of AI-powered tools like curriculum generator, presentation maker, and lesson plan generator | Integrates with learning management systems, streamlines lesson planning | May require additional customization for specific needs |
| [**Aspose.ai**](http://aspose.ai) | Educational activities and content creation | Collection of free and paid tools for engaging activities (e.g., AI Crossword Generator) | Promotes self-directed learning, fosters critical thinking skills | Individual tools may require separate subscriptions |
| [**Almanack**](https://www.almanack.ai/) | Lesson planning and curriculum development | Integrates lesson planning, curriculum alignment, assessment creation, and resource generation | Comprehensive solution for educators, saves planning time | May have a steeper learning curve for new users |
| [**Teachology**](https://www.teachology.ai) | Personalized learning and course design | Combines AI with human expertise to design courses, build assessments, and customize lesson plans | Tailored learning experiences, caters to individual student needs | Cost may be a factor for some institutions |
| [**EdPuzzle**](https://edpuzzle.com/) | Interactive video lessons | Creates interactive video lessons with embedded quizzes and assignments | Enhances engagement with online learning, promotes active learning | May not be suitable for all types of learning content |

**To Use or Not to Use AI**

AI is a tool that is neither inherently good nor bad; its impact depends on how it is utilized. Educators can use AI as a supportive tool that enhances their capabilities. It is not replacing instructions any time soon. AI's strength lies in its ability to handle repetitive tasks, organize information, and provide creative suggestions. Unlike educators, AI is not a content expert; it aggregates information from various sources, which can sometimes lead to inaccuracies (Al hallucinations). Thus, an educator is needed to verify AI-generated content.

The U.S. Department of Education has not yet established a standardized policy specifically addressing the use of AI in higher education. This decentralized approach gives universities flexibility in adopting AI tools but also creates uncertainty regarding best practices and potential risks. Universities are taking the initiative to develop their own policies on AI use to define ethical use while keeping transparency in mind.

Stay tuned to your initiative by your institute and explore AI because your students are definitely using it.
